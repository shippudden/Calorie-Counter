## Project Description: Fitness Calorie Counter

**Overview:**
The Fitness Calorie Counter is a web-based application designed to help users track their calorie expenditure based on their daily physical activities. By inputting the minutes spent on walking, running, and cycling, users can easily calculate the total calories burned in a user-friendly interface. The application also adapts to users' preferences, offering a seamless experience in both light and dark modes.

**Key Features:**
- **Activity Input:** Users can input the number of minutes spent on three types of activities: walking, running, and cycling.
- **Calorie Calculation:** The application calculates total calories burned based on the provided activity durations, with specific calorie rates assigned to each activity:
  - Walking: 5 calories per minute
  - Running: 10 calories per minute
  - Cycling: 8 calories per minute
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for various devices, ensuring usability on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Dynamic Result Display:** The total calories burned are displayed prominently, allowing users to easily track their progress. The form resets after calculating to facilitate new entries while keeping the total calories visible.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Utilizing the `prefers-color-scheme` media query, the application automatically adjusts its color scheme based on user preferences, enhancing visibility and comfort. The background wave animations also adapt, offering a consistent and appealing aesthetic in both light and dark modes.

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML:** For the structure of the application.
- **CSS:** For styling, including responsive design and animations.
- **JavaScript:** For functionality, handling user input, calculations, and dynamic updates to the UI.

**Conclusion:**
The Fitness Calorie Counter is a practical tool for fitness enthusiasts and anyone looking to monitor their physical activity. By simplifying the process of tracking calories burned, the application encourages users to maintain an active lifestyle while providing a visually appealing and intuitive experience.
